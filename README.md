# Spatial Transcriptomics Decodes the Heterogeneity of the Consensus Molecular Subtypes of Colorectal Cancer

This repository contains the scripts developed for the analysis of a set of CRC samples processed with the 10x VISIUM Spatial Transcriptomics technology. These results are presented in the following publication: 

The study outline is summarized in the following figure: 


We processed fresh-frozen resection samples obtained from seven CRC patients for ST using 10x Genomics VISIUM aiming at exploring spatial molecular heterogeneity in CRC. We considered two serial sections per patient to generate technical replicates.
