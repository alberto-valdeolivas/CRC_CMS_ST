# Charting the heterogeneity of colorectal cancer consensus molecular subtypes using Spatial transcriptomics

We processed fresh-frozen resection samples obtained from seven CRC patients for ST using 10x Genomics VISIUM aiming at exploring spatial molecular heterogeneity in CRC. We considered two serial sections per patient to generate technical replicates.The study outline is summarized in the following figure:

This repository contains the scripts developed for the analysis of this set of CRC samples which results are presented in the following publication: 

XXXXXXXXXX

and it is organized as follows:

* Quality Control
* Deconvolution
* Sample Characterization 
* General Analysis per Sample
* General Integrated analysis
* Figure arrangement 
* Additional analaysis of the external ST CRC samples
* Wrapper Functions

The raw data (count matrices, H&E figures...) and the intermediates files generated during the analysis and required to re-run the analysis are available in zenodo.
