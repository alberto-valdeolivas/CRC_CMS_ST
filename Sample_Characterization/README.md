# Sample Characterization

This folder contains the scripts created to characterize the internal and external ST CRC datasets used in our manuscript based on the deconvolution results.  

* Characterization of our internal ST CRC samples according to the deconvolution results when using as reference the Korean cohort.
* Characterization of our internal ST CRC samples according to the deconvolution results when using as reference the Belgian cohort.
* Comparison of deconvolution-based sample characterization between both used references.
* Characterization of the external ST CRC samples. 

Moreover, we performed pseudo-bulk in our samples and classified then to the different CMS using [CMScaller](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-16747-x)

* Classification of our internal ST CRC dataset
* Classification of the external ST CRC dataset
