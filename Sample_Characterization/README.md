# Sample Characterization

This folder contains the scripts created to characterize the internal and external ST CRC datasets used in our manuscript based on different criteria.  

### Direct charazterization of samples based on the deconvolution results: 

* [37_Comparison_Korean_Belgian.Rmd](https://github.com/alberto-valdeolivas/ST_CRC_CMS/blob/main/Sample_Characterization/37_Comparison_Korean_Belgian.Rmd): Characterization of our internal ST CRC samples according to the deconvolution results when using as reference the Korean or the Belgian cohort. It also includes the comparison of the deconvolution results yielded by both references. The HTML notebook is available at zenodo and can be downloaded [here](https://zenodo.org/record/7440183/files/37_Comparison_Korean_Belgian.html?download=1)

* [Pub_Proportion_Plots.Rmd](https://github.com/alberto-valdeolivas/ST_CRC_CMS/blob/main/Sample_Characterization/Pub_Proportion_Plots.Rmd) Characterization of the external ST CRC samples based on the deconvolution results. The HTML notebook is available at zenodo and can be downloaded [here](https://zenodo.org/record/7440183/files/Pub_Proportion_Plots.html?download=1)

### CMScaller CMS classificaion

We perfomed pseudo-bulk in our samples and classified then to the different CMS using [CMScaller](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-16747-x)

* [Pub_CMScallerClassification_Pseudobulk.Rmd](https://github.com/alberto-valdeolivas/ST_CRC_CMS/blob/main/Sample_Characterization/Pub_CMScallerClassification_Pseudobulk.Rmd): Classification of our internal ST CRC dataset. The HTML notebook is available at zenodo and can be downloaded [here](https://zenodo.org/record/7440183/files/Pub_CMScallerClassification_Pseudobulk.html?download=1)
* [Pub_CMSCaller_PseudoBulkClassification.Rmd](https://github.com/alberto-valdeolivas/ST_CRC_CMS/blob/main/Sample_Characterization/Pub_CMSCaller_PseudoBulkClassification.Rmd): Classification of the external ST CRC dataset. The HTML notebook is available at zenodo and can be downloaded [here](https://zenodo.org/record/7440183/files/Pub_CMSCaller_PseudoBulkClassification.html?download=1)
