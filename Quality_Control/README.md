# Quality Control of our set of CRC ST samples

This folder contains the scripts created to perform an in-house quality control on the CRC ST samples. In particular, it is organized as follows:

* [00_QC_GlobalMetrics.Rmd](https://github.com/alberto-valdeolivas/ST_CRC_CMS/blob/main/Quality_Control/00_QC_GlobalMetrics.Rmd): comparison for all the analyzed samples of the global metrics directly extracted from SpaceRanger. The HTML notebook is available at zenodo and can be rendered clicking on this link. 
* [01_QC_ImageBased.Rmd](https://github.com/alberto-valdeolivas/ST_CRC_CMS/blob/main/Quality_Control/01_QC_ImageBased.Rmd): image-based QC where the number of genes and reads is compared between the spots covered by tissue and the non-covered ones. Besides, we compute mitochondrial content and other revelant metrics. The HTML notebook is available at zenodo and can be rendered clicking on this link.
