# General Analysis conducted per sample 

This folder contains general analysis that were conducted individually in every sample from our set of CRC ST samples. In particular, it contains the following analysis: 

* [02_Clustering_Resolution_05.Rmd](https://github.com/alberto-valdeolivas/ST_CRC_CMS/blob/main/General_Analysis_perSample/02_Clustering_Resolution_05.Rmd): Individual cluster per sample of the tissue-covered spots using the Louvain algortihm with the resolution parameter set to 0.5 We find the markers for every cluster and characterize them by doing an enrichment analysis. The HTML notebook is available at zenodo and can be downloaded [here](https://zenodo.org/record/7440183/files/02_Clustering_Resolution_05.html?download=1)

* [05_PathwayActivity.Rmd](https://github.com/alberto-valdeolivas/ST_CRC_CMS/blob/main/General_Analysis_perSample/05_PathwayActivity.Rmd): We use [PROGENy](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-017-02391-6) to compute the per spot activity of 14 different pathways. The HTML notebook is available at zenodo and can be downloaded [here](https://zenodo.org/record/7440183/files/05_PathwayActivity.html?download=1)

* [06_TF_Activity.Rmd](https://github.com/alberto-valdeolivas/ST_CRC_CMS/blob/main/General_Analysis_perSample/06_TF_Activity.Rmd): We used [Viper](https://www.nature.com/articles/ng.3593) coupled with [dorothea regulons](https://genome.cshlp.org/content/29/8/1363) to compute the per spot Transcription factor activity. The HTML notebook is available at zenodo and can be downloaded [here](https://zenodo.org/record/7440183/files/06_TF_Activity.html?download=1)
