# Deconvolution of CRC ST samples using Cell2Location

This folder contains the scripts created to perform deconvolution on the CRC ST samples using the [Cell2Location](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-021-01139-4) method based on the annotations from a [scRNA-seq reference dataset](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-020-0636-z) generated in the context of a recent publication. In particular, it is organized as follows:

* Deconvolution of our set of CRC ST samples using as reference the annotations from the scRNA-seq generated from a Korean cohort (SMC dataset). 
* Deconvolution of our set of CRC ST samples using as reference the annotations from the scRNA-seq generated from a Belgian cohort (KUL3 dataset). 
* Deconvolution of the external CRC ST samples using as reference the annotations from the scRNA-seq generated from a Korean cohort (SMC dataset).
